# *Transforming Data with Python*

***In this mini-project, we'll be working with a dataset of submissions to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) from 2006 to 2015.<br>We'll be writing scripts and running them via `Command Line`. We will try to answer these questions:***

- What words appear most often in the headlines?
- What domains were submitted most often to Hacker News?
- At what times are the most articles submitted?
