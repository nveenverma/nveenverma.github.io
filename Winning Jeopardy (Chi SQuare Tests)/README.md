***Jeopardy is a popular TV show in US, where participants answer questions to win money. In this mini-project, we will explore a dataset containing 20000 rows of Jeopardy questions. We want to compete on Jeopardy, and we're looking for any edge we can get to win.<br><br>Here, we'll try to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help us win. And make use of Chi-Square Tests.***
