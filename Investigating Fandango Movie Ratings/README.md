# *Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings*

***In October 2015, Walt Hickey from FiveThirtyEight published a popular article where he presented strong evidence which suggest that Fandango's movie rating system was biased and dishonest.<br><br> In this mini-project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.***
