***In this mini-project, we will explore a [dataset](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv) complied by Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania. This data set contains percent bachelor's degress offered to women.<br><br>We will explore the gender gap in STEM fields(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). If there is a gap, we will try to visualise it.***
