# *Answering Business Questions*

***In this mini-project, we'll be working with a modified version of a database called Chinook. The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store. It contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases.<br><br>We'll provide solutions to few Business Questions by analysing data from Chinook Database.***
