# *Predicting Car Prices*

***In this mini-project, we will be working with dataset on various cars. It contains information/technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more.<br><br>We will predict a car's market price using its attributes and cover concepts like `K-Nearest Neighbors, Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning, RMSE, Cross Validation.`***
